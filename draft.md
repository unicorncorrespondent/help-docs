    hamnet is more on the one star size because it fails at almost all authentic attempt. 
    I refer to Chole as inauthentic because I hope she can do way more than this.

Why one star
    The central theme of grief is presented shallowly.
    - five stage of grief:  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. The characters are in stage 2 and 4 statically, with no deeper dynamic going on. 
    - A good (and IMO, best) example of grief: Joan Didion's blue night, where she grief the death of her daughter. In her previous book, the year of magical thinking, which is also about mourning the death of her husband, she showed us how she went through the five stage of grief. In blue night, she went even deeper, into the realm of regret and guilt, and ultimately, how one completely reconstruct their story of life based on one thing, grief. This is the real power of grief. It's been presented in such elegent and vulunerable way.
    - the self-reflection, regret and guilt is so powerful that it moves us deeply. This is why the sun rises on us all (2025) inspired so much discussion within and beyond our panel.
    - Hamnet, compared to these works, has done nothing new with grief. I have no doubt that the actress Jessie Buckly might have experienced the power of grief and tried her best presenting, but the work itself greatly impede the performance and reduce the impact we should recieve from her acting.
    
    Building on the previous statement, I suggest that the strong emotion impact does not come from the movie itself. 
    - It relies too much on other great work, i.e., Hamlet and the soundtrack, which is cheating IMO. The best way to test it is to ask oneself: will I be so touched if I have never heard of hamlet or shakespear, and there is no music playing in the background in the last scene? 
    - I don't think the answer will be yes, because the film does not build any convincing relationship between characters. No details show how deep the couple love their kids (and each other) other than some routine acts like playing around and talking about the future.
    - It relies too much on recognition, rather than actual development, where we are expected to recognise something and immediately can place ourselves into the context because we have seen it so many times. This is not how art works. This is how meme works. This is how Pavlov trained his dog to siliva, and how Max Richer trained us to cry. It's effective: I used dozens of tissue while watching; but it's cheap, my tear stopped running the moment it ends.

    If we say the more traditional aspect of the artwork in this film failed, the modern aspect of the film, female perspective, is also completely out-dated – if there is anything at all.
    - From the perspective of script, a lively, witch-like female full of nature's unpredicted spirit is saved by her silent and distant hudsband. His art magically comfort her anger, and lead her to understand how to let go of grief. Again, female should ultimately be saved by a male. In a time when Titanian came out and won Palm'O dor 5 years ago.
    - However, not all films based on traditional script have such traditional presence. [I need an example here! One film that comes to my mind is Wuthering Height (2011), but the original book is not considered tradition-traditional.] 

It's easy to understand. And yes, that is exactly why people also rate it five stars.
